The formula for Simple Interest (SI) is:

𝑆

=
𝑃

𝑇
100
SI= 
100
P×R×T
​
 
Where:

P = Principal amount
R = Rate of interest per annum
T = Time in years





# Given values for simple interest calculation
P = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
R = 5      # Rate of interest per annum in percentage
T = 3      # Time in years

# Simple Interest formula
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
